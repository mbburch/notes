# 1507 Retro Notes August 28th

## Sad

* Regis: loved SQL, sad about Sequel b/c he wants to use SQL
* Travis: tension between people asking questions they are interested in, and class getting off topic and bogged down.
* Adam: code along. It was overwhelming and I felt lost.
* MB: excited about learning a ton of new interesting stuff, but feeling overwhelmed and not sure how to prioritize.
* Matt E: Putting it mildly, I had problems getting Capybara to do what I wanted it to. He also found capybara stuffed animals on Amazon and one is coming!


## Meh

* Chris: Prioritizing. So much coming our way!
* Matt H: Loading us with lots of info. Matt knows that he has a question, but there's not time to ask or really name what he doesn't understand. He's glad he has time this weekend to figure it out.
* Alon: Only getting the tips of lots of icebergs. Hard for him not to have time for mastery. Working more with others to figure it out, less feeling he has the mastery to teach it to others. Josh says the whole module is just exploring the tips. And that's the feeling of being a programmer.
* Mimi: Happy we are all together now in one group. It's an adjustment, with bringing all our learning styles together and figuring out who we are together.
* Justin P: Feels like he is swimming and chasing a boat. Just when he catches it and gets a breath, the boat takes off.
* Russell: Feels like we're on a treadmill.
* Justin H: Nokogiri is the coolest shit, and we just brushed past it. Josh M. says there will be more time, and the point was to make Capybara less magical.


## Happy

* Jerrod: Liked learning Sequel
* David: Really loved the Bootstrap lesson.
* Rose: using data in a way that is not sales engine. Getting tools, and working with data.
* Ryan: Jeff's lesson on databases. Would like to follow up with heavy database shit in DSA.
* Travis would like to learn more about sharding.
* Michael: It's crazy how much we've learned in a week. It needs to sink in, but cool.
* Josh: class capybara. There will be a naming contest.
* George: Pleased with how we've integrated. George is learning from Foxtrot folks and likes how we're helping each other.
* Bret: Liked having two instructors in the room at all times. Tess was super helpful at helping us solve individual problems.

## Pace and Understanding

* As a programmer, there's always more things you don't understand than things that you do understand. On the job, you'll always be learning better ways to solve problems. Get good at setting your ego aside, and be okay failing and having people pick apart your work. Be comfortable being uncomfortable.
* Michael likes what Jeff says that if you always been someone who's good at things, it's hard to get used to this feeling of being stuck.
* Russell says this week is a flashback to when he first started learning programming.
* Josh says take a step back, look at the progress you've made, and take on little chunks at a time. Keep a positive outlook.
* Travis: breaking things into small chunks is one of the most important lessons I've learned when things seem insurmountable. Remind yourself where we were 7 weeks ago... I didn't know shit, even though I could follow along with those nerds from Pragmatic Studios. I've felt this way for each project, and I've been able to do it.
* MB thinks more opportunities to see what people are doing and how they are working through problems. Check in about Task Manager, etc.
* Travis: cheesy teacher idea... Jigsaw breakouts to learn something and teach it to the group. Gallery walks, etc. Have a shout out board for positive thoughts.
* Tess says her cohort could've used more positive feedback and praise.
* Josh says our styling seems high quality overall. This first week of mod 2 is always crazy. He's impressed by the ground covered.
* Justin H. says more speed would help his focus. Maybe split into groups or have more people in the hotseat or driving and navigating.
* Bret: Once we did the database, it would've been cool to split into groups to work on the individual methods. **JOSH--- You want to do this. Here's your reminder!**


## What to prioritize and focus on... and what not to

### To Remember:

* WHERE is used in Active Record and sequel. Get comfortable using it.
* Set up testing. Be comfortable, but don't have to memorize it.
* CRUD: How to do everything CRUD related within Sinatra. Try to memorize it; this will force you to learn some sequel stuff.
* How things get into params hash... *through URL and through Forms*. Understand those two things.  

### Less Important:

* Setting up Sinatra. Maybe okay to copy and paste set up for it.
